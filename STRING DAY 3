Output Format

print the number into string type.
Sample Input 0

0
Sample Output 0

Integer is 0 and String is Zero
Sample Input 1

2
Sample Output 1

Integer is 2 and String is Two
Sample Input 2

10
Sample Output 2

Invalid Input

INPUT:

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
n = int(input().strip())

num_to_str = {
    0: "Zero",
    1: "One",
    2: "Two",
    3: "Three",
    4: "Four",
    5: "Five",
    6: "Six",
    7: "Seven",
    8: "Eight",
    9: "Nine"
}

if 0 <= n <= 9:
    print(f"Integer is {n} and String is {num_to_str[n]}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
